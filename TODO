Refactor JS code to have a shadowcaster library

Simon: touch feedback

Toggles: make work for all mobile

Switches: Make them circles

Shorter flags, in case copy and paste doesn't work

Reveal flag on "youve already released this flag" page

User Notifications (SA is near)

More points for early solves

Admin Interface for SC
 - Create a web interface for changing the shadowcaster puzzle number
 - Adjust the energy levels
 - Stun and flag duration
 - test LEDs; Get GPIO status



**Running the Game**
Rotate SA locations (inside/outside) if it's cold
Make sure there are places to hide around SC locations
Stunning maybe takes points away
Glow sticks for SAs
