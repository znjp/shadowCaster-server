# TODO

## High Priority
- Refactor JS code to have a shadowcaster library

- <strike>Simon: touch feedback</strike>

- <strike>Toggles: make work for all mobile</strike>

- <strike>Switches: Make them circles</strike>

- <strike>fix 9</strike>

- <strike>when changing shadowcaster # reset the database, including recomputing flags</strike>

### Low to Medium Priority
- <strike>Shorter flags, in case copy and paste doesn't work</strike>

- <strike>Reveal flag on "you've already released this flag" page </strike>

- More points for early solves

- Create a flag generation scheme that can't be solved through code inspection

- Refactor to remove JavaScript processing

- <strike>I solved SC5, then visited SC6 and it said it had already been solved. Look into this.</strike>

- Look into a hash function whose domain is english words (or write our own)

- Make puzzles simpler to integrate, or at least write some documentation on how to.


## New Puzzle Ideas
- Lights Out
- "plug board" substitution cipher

#### To Categorize
##### Admin Interface for SC
 - <strike> Create a web interface for changing the shadowcaster puzzle number</strike>
 - <strike> Adjust the energy levels</strike>
 - <strike> Stun and flag duration</strike>
 - <strike> test LEDs; Get GPIO status</strike>
 - Add/remove teams; change password
 - <strike> template for printing out team credentials </strike>
 - Single button to Reset everything (all solves, energy levels) for new game
 - <strike> changing sc number resets all flags and sloved status </strike>

##### Real DB integration
 - <stirke> teams</strike>
 - <strike>sc settings</strike>

##### Scoreboard integration
 - Have a way to configure the auto submitting of flags if the SC's can have internet access
 - Have a way to lock a team to a single shadowcaster at a time; once logged in to one, can't log into another?

##### "Push" notifications
 - Alert on puzzles screen when a ShadowAgent is near

**Running the Game**
- Rotate SA locations (inside/outside) if it's cold
- Make sure there are places to hide around SC locations
- Stunning maybe takes points away?
- Glow sticks for SAs
- Explain the rules of flag submitting
- More points for early solves (motivate splitting up/working independently)
