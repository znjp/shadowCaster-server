## High Priority
1. Refactor JS code to have a shadowcaster library

2. <strike>Simon: touch feedback</strike>

3. <strike>Toggles: make work for all mobile</strike>

4. <strike>Switches: Make them circles</strike>

5. <strike>fix 9</strike>

6. New puzzles

### Low to Medium Priority
- Shorter flags, in case copy and paste doesn't work

- Reveal flag on "you've already released this flag" page

- More points for early solves

- Refactor to remove JavaScript processing

- I solved SC5, then visited SC6 and it said it had already been solved. Look into this.

#### To Categorize
##### Admin Interface for SC
 <strike>- Create a web interface for changing the shadowcaster puzzle number</strike>
 <strike> - Adjust the energy levels</strike>
 <strike> - Stun and flag duration</strike>
 <strike> - test LEDs; Get GPIO status</strike>
 - Add/remove teams; change password
 - template for printing out team credentials
 - Single button to Reset everything (all solves, energy levels) for new game

##### Real DB integration
 - teams
 - sc settings

##### Scoreboard integration
 - Have a way to configure the auto submitting of flags if the SC's can have internet access
 - Have a way to lock a team to a single shadowcaster at a time; once logged in to one, can't log into another?

##### "Push" notifications
 - Alert on puzzles screen when a ShadowAgent is near

**Running the Game**
- Rotate SA locations (inside/outside) if it's cold
- Make sure there are places to hide around SC locations
- Stunning maybe takes points away
- Glow sticks for SAs
- Explain the rules of flag submitting
- More points for early solves (motivate splitting up/working independently)
